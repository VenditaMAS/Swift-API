/**
 A protocol which allows a type to declare all
 of the state required to make a MAS API request,
 including the HTTP method, the targeted resource,
 and so on.
 
 The HTTP method is an associated type rather than a
 property. This allows us to constrain the method of
 the request _at compile time_. For an example, see
 `Api.post`.
 
 For GET, DELETE, and any other HTTP method that
 does not allow a request body, do not implement this
 protocol. Instead, use the `ResourceRequest` type
 or better yet the `Get` or `Delete` typealiases of it.

     of some sort. This is usually a `FullyQualifiedName` or
     `CaseSensitiveUUID`. This property represents
     the collection of identifiers (if any) used
     in making the request.

     they are concatenated together in the URL, e.g.,

 The lower-level interface to the API. The methods in this protocol are used as building blocks for the higher-level
 APIs. The `send` overloads are the lowest level methods in MASApi. They know nothing about the "envelopes" in which
 the results of MAS API calls are returned. Instead of `send`, it is generally best to use `first` and `list`,
 which are aware of response envelopes and understand paging, etc.
